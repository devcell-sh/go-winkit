// Guest-side diagnostics.
//
// Most of what goes wrong in a Windows cell is invisible from the host: the
// host can see that SSH does not answer, but not whether the NIC driver bound,
// which drive letter a device got, or whether a first-logon command failed.
// SSH would answer all of that, but SSH is usually the thing that is broken.
//
// So the guest writes its own report to the answer volume — removable, FAT,
// already attached, and readable from the host with ReadFileFromFAT. No
// network, no agent, and no keyboard automation, which under TCG proved
// unreliable: injected keystrokes auto-repeated and latched modifiers down.

// GenerateGuestDiagnosticsScript returns the PowerShell run at first logon.
//
// It locates its own volume by looking for the answer file rather than
// assuming a drive letter — Windows assigns those dynamically, and a wrong
// guess is exactly what made the NetKVM failure so hard to pin down.
